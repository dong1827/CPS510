Website: https://cps-510.vercel.app/

The website only contains the front end stuff. Currently it's connected to backend hosted on my own pc, which only works if my pc is on. 
To get the website working on your own pc, you can run "npm start" in the Front_End folder, then running "pip install -r requirement.txt" and "python Base.py" in the Back_End folder, and then change the fetch url in front end to localhost:5000. (i.e. replace https://visually-talented-grubworm.ngrok-free.app with localhost:5000)
