Website: https://cps-510.vercel.app/

The website only contains the front end stuff. To get the website working, you'll have to host a backend server. 
You can host a local backend server by running "python Base.py" in the Back_End folder, and then change the fetch url to localhost:5000. (i.e. replace https://visually-talented-grubworm.ngrok-free.app with localhost:5000)
